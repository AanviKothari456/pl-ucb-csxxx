  <p>(From Summer 23 Midterm)</p>
  <p>Weâ€™d like to make a procedure called MEAN that takes in a non-empty list of Midterm
  scores for CS10 students, and returns the average score. The average score is the sum of
  the scores of all students divided by the total number of students.</p>
  <p>For example, given the list [10, -20, 300, 60], the average score is:
  (10 + (-20) + 300 + 60) / 4 = 350 / 4 = 87.5, which is what the procedure MEAN
  should report.</p>
